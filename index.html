    <p>&lt;h1&gt; HI &lt;/h1&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt; Welcome to my application to Founders and Coders &lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt; The code magically appearing on your screen is being generated with more code &lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt; This is an issue. I've written code that can, well, write code by itself. What use am I then? &lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt; What have I done? Sabotaging my own future career like this was not a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt; Not too long before the robots take over <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt; But before then, there are more productive, and socially pertinent things to be done with code than writing a fake AI as a gag. &lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt; So on a more serious note, scroll down to know more about me, my journey with code so far, and why I'm applying to Founders and Coders! &lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>

      <article class="intro">
        <p>I'm 19 years old, and taking my first steps towards finding a career that makes me feel comfortable, but not too comfortable; one that throws challenges at me every day, and always keeps me motivated to learn more.
           I have always enjoyed the process of immersing myself into practicing a skill, something that screams at you to get better at every chance you find, something that motivates you and gives you purpose.
           High School did exactly the opposite for me, I did not get along with the traditional system of education, it wasnt long before i felt suffocated and directionless.
           So after school, I followed what my heart was telling me at the time, to study music, as it was the only thing i saw myself staying committed to. Although I was aware of the potential pitfalls of trying to earn a living through art, I simply did not know what else to do at the time.
           Halfway through my first year, my family decided to move from India to the UK, and this was as exciting as it was terrifying for me.
           What followed after I got here was a rather shocking realisation about the cost of university, which led me to wonder if I really should be studying music.
           I started looking at what else I could do, and in desperately searching for a path, I found Founders and Coders. This model of educating yourself, along with a group of equally motivated individuals, and giving back to the community was such a novel concept to me! I remember the first time I read through the FAC website; to me it seemed like this was everything I felt lacking in the educational atmospheres of my past"
           I told myself I would be dumb not to jump at the opportunity. A big, scary jump indeed, the thought of being among graduates and professionals was ridiculously intimidating at first. All of this changed when I started going for FAC meetups. Never before have I felt so welcome in a learning environment. Everyone is so helpful, applicants, alumni, organisers alike.
           I started teaching myself how to code in October 2018, and was initially planning on applying to the December cohort. At the end of the application period I was feeling fairly competent in Javascript, however I really felt like my css skills needed some more polishing before I applied. What freecodecamp didn't give me were roadblocks, and any programmer would know the importance of getting stuck repeatedly to eventually become more competent at a skill.
           So I decided to give myself some more time, and apply for the next cohort.
           In that time I focussed on practicing the concepts I had learnt. I worked my way through Wes Bos' 30 day javascript challenge(click to view a compilation of my finished projets), which was a series of projects built using vanilla javascript. Besides making me exponentially more omfortable with es6, it helped me polish my css skills as well! Watching an experienced developer style layouts was very insightful!
           I then spent some more time reading about and practicing css grid and flexbox, which was so much fun! The responsiveness of this website is based on css grid!
           In the meantime I'v enjoyed attending meetups and helping fellow applicants on their applications as well!
           I'm looking forward to taking my journey as a developer even further. CSS subgrid awaits me, as well as many many other mountains of code to conquer!
           Oh and if you were wondering, the piano on the left is based on one of the projects from JS30, a drumkit triggered by keyboard input. I had to make my website musical somehow :D
           Thank You for reading through my application website. Links to FreeCodeCamp, Codewars and the GitHub repo for this website are provided below.
